Simple Logger, Console
================================================================

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around the standard console logger. "Simple" is intended to be a highly reduced interface
that allows for better interoperability and dependency choice for consumers._

This package provides a light wrapper around the console logger that enforces conformity
with the `SimpleLoggerInterface` defined in
[`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://github.com/wymp/ts-simple-interfaces/tree/current/packages/ts-simple-interfaces).

Specifically, this gives you the ability to tone down the messages logged to the console in the
browser.
