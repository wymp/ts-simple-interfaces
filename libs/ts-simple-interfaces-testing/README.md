ts-simple-interfaces-testing
====================================================================================

This package provides specialized test structures that implement the ts-simple-interfaces.

**NOTE: To prevent dependency hell for trivialities, this library accepts any version of
`ts-simple-interfaces`. However, it is not actually compatible with all versions.**

**NOTE: As of v0.5.0 this project is now mantained by [Wymp](https://github.com/wymp) and the
package is published on github. Please use `@wymp/ts-simple-interfaces-testing` for future versions of
this package. (This will require setting up an `.npmrc` file at some level with the following line:
`@wymp:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/wymp`.)**
