# Simple Logger, Winston

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around winston logger. "Simple" is intended to be a highly reduced interface that allows
for better interoperability and dependency choice for consumers._

This package provides a light wrapper around the winston logger that enforces conformity
with the `SimpleLoggerInterface` defined in
[`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://github.com/wymp/ts-simple-interfaces/tree/current/packages/ts-simple-interfaces).
