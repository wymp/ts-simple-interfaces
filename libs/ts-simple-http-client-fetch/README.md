Simple Http Client, Fetch
==================================================================================================================

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around fetch. "Simple" is intended to be a highly reduced interface that allows for better
interoperability and dependency choice for consumers._

This package provides a light wrapper around fetch that enforces conformity with the `SimpleHttpClientInterface`
defined in [`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://npmjs.com/packages/@wymp/ts-simple-interfaces).
See that package for information about the interface.
