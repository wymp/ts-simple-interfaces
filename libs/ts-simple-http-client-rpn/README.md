# Simple Http Client, Request-Promise-Native

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around request-promise-native_

**NOTE: As of v0.5.0 this project is now mantained by [Wymp](https://github.com/wymp) and the
package is published on github. Please use `@wymp/simple-http-client-rpn` for future versions of
this package. (This will require setting up an `.npmrc` file at some level with the following line:
`@wymp:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/wymp`.)**

This package provides a light wrapper around request-promise-native that enforces conformity
with the `SimpleHttpClientInterface` defined in
[`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://github.com/wymp/ts-simple-interfaces/tree/current/packages/ts-simple-interfaces).
See that package for information about the interface.
