# Simple Http Client, Request-Promise-Native

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around request-promise-native. "Simple" is intended to be a highly reduced interface that
allows for better interoperability and dependency choice for consumers._

This package provides a light wrapper around request-promise-native that enforces conformity
with the `SimpleHttpClientInterface` defined in
[`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://github.com/wymp/ts-simple-interfaces/tree/current/packages/ts-simple-interfaces).
See that package for information about the interface.
