Simple Http Client, Request-Promise-Native
==================================================================================================================

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around request-promise-native. "Simple" is intended to be a highly reduced interface that
allows for better interoperability and dependency choice for consumers._

**DEPRECATION NOTICE: This package is deprecated, since the underlying `request` library (and the higher-level
`request-promise-native`) is deprecated.** Use [@wymp/simple-http-client-fetch](https://npmjs.com/package/@wymp/simple-http-client-fetch)
as an alternative.**

This package provides a light wrapper around request-promise-native that enforces conformity with the
`SimpleHttpClientInterface` defined in [`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://npmjs.com/packages/@wymp/ts-simple-interfaces).
See that package for information about the interface.
