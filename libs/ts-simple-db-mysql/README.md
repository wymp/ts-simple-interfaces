Simple Db, MySQL
=================================================================================================

_A Simple™-conformant wrapper around the `mysql2` library. "Simple" is intended to be a highly reduced interface that
allows for better interoperability and dependency choice for consumers._

This package provides a light wrapper around mysql2 that enforces conformity
with the `SimpleSqlDbInterface` defined in
[`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://github.com/wymp/ts-simple-interfaces/tree/current/packages/ts-simple-interfaces).
See that package for information about the interface.
