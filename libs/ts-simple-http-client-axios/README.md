# Simple Http Client, Axios

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around axios. "Simple" is intended to be a highly reduced interface that allows for better
interoperability and dependency choice for consumers._

This package provides a light wrapper around axios that enforces conformity with
the `SimpleHttpClientInterface` defined in
[`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://github.com/wymp/ts-simple-interfaces/tree/current/packages/ts-simple-interfaces).
See that package for information about the interface.
