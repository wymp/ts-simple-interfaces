# Simple HTTP Server, Express

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around ExpressJS. "Simple" is intended to be a highly reduced interface that allows for
better interoperability and dependency choice for consumers._

**NOTE:** This library is experimental right now and in active beta development. While you may feel free to use it, it
is expected to change considerably.

This package provides a light wrapper around ExpressJS that enforces conformity with the `SimpleHttpServerInterface`
defined in [`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://github.com/wymp/ts-simple-interfaces/tree/current/packages/ts-simple-interfaces).

See that package for information about the interface.

At the time of this writing, this package is not meant to be a fully-functional, do-it-all web service framework. To the
contrary, it is meant to be a pared down, simplified building block that _just_ does routing and listening. It may grow
to be more in the future, but for now, the goal is that it remain Simple.
