# Simple HTTP Server, Express

_A Simpleâ„¢-conformant wrapper around ExpressJS_


**NOTE:** This library is experimental right now and in active alpha development. While you may
feel free to use it, it is expected to change considerably.

**SECOND NOTE: As of v0.5.0 this project is now mantained by [Wymp](https://github.com/wymp) and the
package is published on github. Please use `@wymp/ts-simple-http-server-express` for future versions
of this package. (This will require setting up an `.npmrc` file at some level with the following line:
`@wymp:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/wymp`.)**

This package provides a light wrapper around ExpressJS that enforces conformity with the
`SimpleHttpServerInterface` defined in
[`ts-simple-interfaces`](https://github.com/wymp/ts-simple-interfaces/tree/current/packages/ts-simple-interfaces).

See that package for information about the interface.

At the time of this writing, this package is not meant to be a fully-functional, do-it-all web
service framework. To the contrary, it is meant to be a pared down, simplified building block
that _just_ does routing and listening. It may grow to be more in the future, but for now, the goal
is that it remain Simple.
